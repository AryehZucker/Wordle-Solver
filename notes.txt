TODO:
- make the program save its work before quitting, and load saved work on startup (write loadProgress and saveProgress functions)
- optimize keeping track of a change in simplify (low priority)
- (convert data structures to 'int')
- see if data lookup can be sped up with a hash table
- write my own getMem method to allocate memory gotten from malloc
- shuffle the wordslists to avoid worst case scenarios
